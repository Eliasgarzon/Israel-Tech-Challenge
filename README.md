# Israel-Tech-Challenge

Israel Tech Challenge is an intensive, full-time coding bootcamp designed to qualify full stack developers. In this repo you will find all the projects/assignments I did during the program. The repo is organized in chronological order beginning with my first website using basic HTML, CSS and Js. 

>NOTE: The program is still ongoing and thus, as I move along, I will continue to update this repo! 

### Structure 
Each project/assignment has its own readme file. In there you will find all the source code, description of the assignments and also my thoughts on what I learned and things I could improve.
